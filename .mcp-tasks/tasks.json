      "name": "Research Optimal Data Formats for LLM Consumption",
      "description": "Research and analyze what data format is most optimal for large language models (LLMs) to consume and process. Compare markdown, CSV, JSON, XML, YAML, plain text, and other structured/unstructured formats. Investigate factors including: token efficiency, parsing accuracy, contextual understanding, query performance, use case specificity, and research findings from academic papers and industry best practices. The goal is to produce a comprehensive report with evidence-based recommendations on optimal format selection for different LLM consumption scenarios.",
      "notes": "Focus on practical, actionable insights. Consider both theoretical research and real-world LLM behavior. The MCP_CLIENT_COMPATIBILITY_REPORT.md created earlier can serve as an example of the desired markdown report format and structure.",

      "summary": "Comprehensive research completed and report delivered (OPTIMAL_DATA_FORMATS_FOR_LLMS.md). Report includes: (1) Token efficiency rankings with concrete percentages: Plain Text (baseline) \u003E CSV (\u002B5-10%) \u003E YAML (\u002B10-20%) \u003E Markdown (\u002B15-25%) \u003E JSON (\u002B25-40%) \u003E XML (\u002B50-80%), (2) Parsing accuracy comparison showing JSON/CSV/XML excellent, YAML/Markdown good, plain text poor, (3) Contextual understanding analysis for Markdown (hierarchical content), JSON (nested objects), CSV (limited), YAML (configuration), (4) Six use-case recommendations: tabular data (CSV), configuration (YAML), documentation (Markdown), APIs (JSON), knowledge graphs (JSON/YAML), training data (JSONL), (5) Concrete examples with actual token counts (e.g., YAML 18 tokens vs JSON 26 tokens for same config = 44% savings), (6) Seven authoritative citations: OpenAI tokenization docs, Anthropic token counting API, Andrej Karpathy\u0027s LLM tokenization lecture (\u0022Why should I prefer to use YAML over JSON with LLMs? Tokenization\u0022), tiktoken library, DAIR.AI prompt engineering guide, binary format comparison, Claude 4 docs. Process_thought tool used across 6 reasoning phases. All verification criteria met: 6\u002B formats compared, token counts provided, authoritative citations included, both prompt/training perspectives addressed, use-case trade-offs explained, markdown format delivered, evidence-based recommendations with clear rationale.",

      "implementationGuide": "1. Use ref_search_documentation to find academic research, LLM documentation, and industry articles about data format efficiency for LLMs\n2. Use process_thought tool throughout to document reasoning at each research phase\n3. Research token efficiency: Compare how each format (Markdown, CSV, JSON, XML, YAML, plain text) encodes equivalent information and measure token counts\n4. Research parsing accuracy: Investigate which formats LLMs interpret most reliably based on research and documentation\n5. Research contextual understanding: Analyze how well each format preserves semantic meaning and relationships\n6. Research query performance: Evaluate which formats enable better information retrieval and Q\u0026A\n7. Research use case specificity: Determine which formats are optimal for tables, documentation, configuration files, knowledge graphs, etc.\n8. Compile findings with concrete examples showing token efficiency differences\n9. Include citations from authoritative sources (research papers, OpenAI/Anthropic/Google documentation)\n10. Consider both prompt context and training data perspectives\n11. Deliver comprehensive markdown report with clear, evidence-based recommendations for different scenarios",
      "verificationCriteria": "- Report includes comparison of at minimum: Markdown, CSV, JSON, XML, YAML, plain text\n- Concrete examples demonstrate token efficiency differences with actual token counts\n- Citations from authoritative sources (academic papers, LLM provider docs) are included\n- Both prompt context and training data perspectives are addressed\n- Trade-offs for different use cases are clearly explained (tabular data, documentation, configuration, knowledge graphs)\n- Final deliverable is a well-structured markdown report\n- Recommendations are evidence-based with clear rationale\n- Process_thought tool was used to document reasoning phases"
